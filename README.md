## SAMP BitStream Crash Fix
This plugin fixes the issue with BitStream read overruns for functinos `BitStream::ReadBits`, `BitStream::Read`, and `BitStream::ReadBool` (only on windows)

Please go to https://github.com/AmyrAhmady/samp-bscrashfix/releases and download latest version

All you need to do is to copy plugin file for your platform and add it to your `server.cfg`

**Note:** open.mp is not affected by this exploit.


**We still strongly advise and recommend you all to migrate your servers to open.mp. open.mp servers are fully backward compatible with samp clients so you do not have to worry about your players, all you have to worry is your safety and server security since open.mp contains numerous security, game behavior, and scripting fixes!**
